The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents from the years 2017-2020. The sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding, leaving it with 32 features and 12316 instances of the accidents. The data is then preprocessed for the identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.
