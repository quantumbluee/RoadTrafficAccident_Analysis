# RoadTrafficAccident_Analysis

*I have done this project under 'The Machine Learning Company's' MGP(Mega Guided Projects) course*

This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments. The dataset has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents from the years 2017-2020. The sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding, leaving it with 32 features and 12316 instances of the accidents. The data is then preprocessed for the identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.  

Source of the dataset -- https://www.narcis.nl/dataset/RecordID/oai%3Aeasy.dans.knaw.nl%3Aeasy-dataset%3A191591

Problem Statement: The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each day's task. Your metric for evaluation will be f1-score
